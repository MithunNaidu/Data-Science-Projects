Here goes a Facial Landmarks detector using OpenCV, dlib, imutils & python, implemented on Google Colab. 
This takes in an image(can also be enhanced for a video input) and;
1) Detects Faces in it(draws a bounding box around them)
2) Detects Facial Landmarks(Eyes, Nose, Eyebrows, Jawline)
These facial landmarks can be scaled up to various applications like blink detection, face swapping, face alignment etc.
You can download & extract the shape predictor used in the project from the internet.

facial_landamarks.pynb detects landmarks by taking in an image as input
video_facial_landmarks.pynb detects landmarks on video(Webcam, video file...)
