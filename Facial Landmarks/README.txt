Here goes a Facial Landmarks detector using OpenCV, dlib, imutils & python, implemented on Google Colab. 
This takes in an image(can also be enhanced for a video input) and;
1) Detects Faces in it(draws a bounding box around them)
2) Detects Facial Landmarks(Eyes, Nose, Eyebrows, Jawline)
These facial landmarks can be scaled up to various applications like blink detection, face swapping, face alignment etc.
You can download & extract the shape predictor used in the project from the internet.
