Here goes a Facial Landmarks detector using OpenCV, dlib, imutils & python, implemented on Google Colab. 
This takes in an image(can also be enhanced for a video input) and;
1) Detects Faces in it(draws a bounding box around them)
2) Detects Facial Landmarks(Eyes, Nose, Eyebrows, Jawline)
These facial landmarks can be scaled up to various applications like blink detection, face swapping, face alignment etc.
